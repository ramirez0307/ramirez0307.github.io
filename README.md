# Artifact Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------

I aim to focus on a single artifact that will allow me to showcase my knowledge and skills in three categories: Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I started working on this project while taking the CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming class, which required the development of a fully functional application as a final project. I created an android inventory app using android studio and the Java language that implements a fully functional sign-in/sign-up feature. Furthermore, this application consists of three major components, inbound, outbound, and display. The inbound enables the user to add a new product, the outbound allows the user the remove a product, and the display allows the user to view a list of all products. Additionally, I implemented a database that holds all the data within the application, allowing the user to interact with this data by adding, deleting, updating, and reading items in the database.
