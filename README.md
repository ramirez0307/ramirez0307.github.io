# Professional Self-Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------



# Artifact Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------

I aim to focus on a single artifact that will allow me to showcase my knowledge and skills in three categories: Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I started working on this project while taking the CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming class, which required the development of a fully functional application as a final project. I created an android inventory app using android studio and the Java language that implements a fully functional sign-in/sign-up feature. Furthermore, this application consists of three major components, inbound, outbound, and display. The inbound enables the user to add a new product, the outbound allows the user the remove a product, and the display allows the user to view a list of all products. Additionally, I implemented a database that holds all the data within the application, allowing the user to interact with this data by adding, deleting, updating, and reading items in the database.

# Refinement Plan
-------------------------------------------------------

### Category One: Software Engineering/Design
I plan to enhance the application's overall design by adding more features to provide the user with a better experience. The original design consists of four activities limiting the user's actions. I will add new screens where the user can perform additional steps such as creating a sales order or adding a new customer. Additionally, I intend to expand the complexity of the design to mimic actual warehouse operations, including picking orders, displaying inventory, shipping products, and performing other regular warehouse activities. Lastly, I will update the overall look of the application to make it more visually appealing by changing the app User-Interface (UI), such as color, text, and the way data is displayed. Also, I will work on the user experience (UX) to focus on the application's usability, objective, and engagement. With this enhancement, I will demonstrate my skills and understanding of the java language, android application development, User-Experience (UX), and User interface (UI). Additionally, this will showcase skills beyond just writing code since I can display mastery in understanding the user's needs and translate those needs into a working application.

### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
I plan to implement a series of algorithms in my application that will allow me to perform certain operations more effectively. For example, the data retrieved from the database must be handled in a specific way before it can adequately be displayed to the user. As a result, I will have to create an algorithm that can execute this action efficiently. I will also improve my use of arrays and implement additional data structures such as ArrayList and HashMaps. ArrayList is essential because, contrary to Array, they don't have a fixed size. Since the amount of data we will handle will vary based on what is being retrieved from the database, it is crucial to use the proper data structure. These enhancements will allow me to display my skills in working with the data structure and my understanding of when is the right time to implement them to accomplish a task efficiently. Also, I will demonstrate my ability to develop and implement an algorithm that works and completes a task efficiently.

### Category Three: Databases
This application uses an SQLite database to store data locally on the android device. I plan to add more tables to give the user access to additional data based on the new features I will implement. Additionally, I intend to improve how the applications interact with the database by creating methods to handle all the queries needed to operate the application. As a result, I will use the concept of CRUD when creating the required methods to interact with the database. By accomplishing this, I will demonstrate my understanding of SQLite and how it works on an android application. Also, I will show my SQL skill by showcasing my ability to use statements to interact with the database correctly, such as SELECT and UPDATE.
